> **No setting commands (3.4.0).** The old `/ai settings`, `/ai token`, `/ai listen`,
> `/ai active` and `/ai commands` were removed — they were too fiddly. **Configure
> everything in the panel** (`/ai panel` / `/ai menu`), which is operator-only
> (`adminPermissionLevel`, default 2 = ops). Everyday commands above stay open to all
> players. Ops on a **vanilla** client can still configure via the text `/ai admin …`
> tree (and the `BLOCKPAL_API_TOKEN` environment variable for the shared key).

## Admin commands (ops only)

The whole `/ai admin` tree is hidden from, and refused to, anyone below the admin
permission level. See **[Admin Menu](Admin-Menu)** for the full guide.

| `/ai admin menu` | Open the visual admin panel |
| `/ai admin stats` | Bots, players, FPS, mod status (text) |
| `/ai admin list` | Every bot and where it is (text) |
| `/ai admin killall` | Remove **all** bots on the server |
| `/ai admin maxbots <0-50>` | Cap bots per server (0 = unlimited) |
| `/ai admin disable` · `/ai admin enable` | Turn all bots off / on for everyone |
| `/ai admin reload` | Reload `config.json` from disk |
| `/ai admin requirekey on\|off` | Make players use their own API key — see [Per-Player Keys & Models](Per-Player-Keys-and-Models) |

| `/ai admin models add\|remove\|list <id>` | Curate the models players may pick |

## Quick intents (no API token)

These common phrases — whether as a command or just typed in chat — are handled
instantly with no LLM call: **come**, **follow**, **stop**, **stay**, **where are you**.

See **[Talking to Your Assistant](Talking-to-Your-Assistant)** for how chat addressing
and active analysis decide what counts as a command.
